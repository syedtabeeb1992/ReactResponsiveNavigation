# ReactResponsiveNavigation
React Responsive navigation for react Apps

To Run
1. npm install
2. npm start

This is a responsive navigation templet which opens up from side, you can make changes to css and modify it as you want

How it works!
in Header.js a state "slide" has been used which is set to false initially, once "onSlideHandler" is called "slide" becomes "!slide" when this happens a backdrop div is added using ternary operation and classes added to the navigation.
